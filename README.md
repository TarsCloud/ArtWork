# artwork

In this repo, we prepare artwork for TARS foundation and foundation's projects in 3 formats (png, svg and ai), 3 layouts -- horizontal (also known as landscape format), stacked (which is closer to square), and icon (which does not include the name and is square), and 3 versions (color/black/white). So, that's at least 27 versions of most logos.
